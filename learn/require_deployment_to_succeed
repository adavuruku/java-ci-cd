The "Require deployments to succeed" setting in a version control system or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a rule that enforces successful deployments to specified environments before allowing changes to be pushed to certain branches or tags. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Require Deployments to Succeed

**Purpose:** This setting ensures that code changes are not pushed to certain branches or tags unless they have been successfully deployed to specified environments. It is used to enforce quality and stability in critical parts of the codebase.

**Details:**
- **Deployment Environments:** You can specify which environments (such as staging, testing, or production) must have successful deployments before changes can be pushed to the branches or tags matching the rule.
- **Pattern Matching:** The pattern can be a specific name, a wildcard, or a regular expression that defines which branches or tags the restriction applies to.
- **Prevent Pushing:** If the specified environments have not had successful deployments, users will be prevented from pushing changes to the branches or tags that match the pattern.
- **Bypass Permissions:** Typically, only users with special permissions (bypass permissions) can override this restriction.

**Example Scenario:**
- Suppose you have a `production` branch that you want to protect to ensure only thoroughly tested and deployed code makes it into this branch. You could set up a rule that requires successful deployments to a `staging` environment before allowing any pushes to the `production` branch.
- With "Require deployments to succeed" enabled for the `production` branch, any attempt to push changes to this branch would be blocked unless the changes have already been successfully deployed to the `staging` environment.

### Benefits of Requiring Successful Deployments

1. **Ensures Stability:** By requiring successful deployments to specified environments, you can ensure that code changes have been thoroughly tested and vetted before being integrated into critical branches or tags.
2. **Improves Quality:** This rule helps maintain high-quality code in important branches, as only changes that pass deployment tests can be pushed.
3. **Prevents Breakages:** It minimizes the risk of introducing breaking changes to production by ensuring they have been successfully deployed and tested in other environments first.

### Implementation in a CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Deployment Configuration:** Set up deployment pipelines for the specified environments (e.g., staging, testing).
2. **Deployment Success Checks:** Ensure that the CI/CD system can track and verify the success of deployments to these environments.
3. **Enforce Rule:** Configure the version control system or CI/CD pipeline to enforce the "Require deployments to succeed" rule, specifying the patterns and environments.

### Summary

The "Require deployments to succeed" setting ensures that code changes are only pushed to certain branches or tags if they have been successfully deployed to specified environments. This rule enhances the stability and quality of critical parts of the codebase by enforcing rigorous testing and deployment processes before allowing changes to be integrated.
